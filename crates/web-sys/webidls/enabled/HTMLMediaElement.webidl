 * HTMLMediaElement::seekToNextFrame() is a Mozilla experimental feature.
 *
 * The SeekToNextFrame() method provides a way to access a video element's video
 * frames one by one without going through the realtime playback. So, it lets
 * authors use "frame" as unit to access the video element's underlying data,
 * instead of "time".
 *
 * The SeekToNextFrame() is a kind of seek operation, so normally, once it is
 * invoked, a "seeking" event is dispatched. However, if the media source has no
 * video data or is not seekable, the operation is ignored without filing the
 * "seeking" event.
 *
 * Once the SeekToNextFrame() is done, a "seeked" event should always be filed
 * and a "ended" event might also be filed depends on where the media element's
 * position before seeking was. There are two cases:
 * Assume the media source has n+1 video frames where n is a non-negative
 * integers and the frame sequence is indexed from zero.
 * (1) If the currentTime is at anywhere smaller than the n-th frame's beginning
 *     time, say the currentTime is now pointing to a position which is smaller
 *     than the x-th frame's beginning time and larger or equal to the (x-1)-th
 *     frame's beginning time, where x belongs to [1, n], then the
 *     SeekToNextFrame() operation seeks the media to the x-th frame, sets the
 *     media's currentTime to the x-th frame's beginning time and dispatches a
 *     "seeked" event.
 * (2) Otherwise, if the currentTime is larger or equal to the n-th frame's
 *     beginning time, then the SeekToNextFrame() operation sets the media's
 *     currentTime to the duration of the media source and dispatches a "seeked"
 *     event and an "ended" event.
