//! Raw API bindings for Web APIs
//!
//! This is a procedurally generated crate from browser WebIDL which provides a
//! binding to all APIs that browsers provide on the web. The source files are maintained [in the
//! crate's webidl directory][1]. The generated API documentation captures most of the information
//! contained in there â€“ if not, it refers back there.
//!
//! [1]: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/tree/master/crates/web-sys/webidls
//!
//! This crate by default contains very little when compiled as almost all of
//! its exposed APIs are gated by Cargo features. The exhaustive list of
//! features can be found in `crates/web-sys/Cargo.toml`, but the rule of thumb
//! for `web-sys` is that each type has its own cargo feature (named after the
//! type). Using an API requires enabling the features for all types used in the
//! API, and APIs should mention in the documentation what features they
//! require.
