# Team

`wasm-bindgen` follows the [`rustwasm` organization's governance described
here][governance]:

* All pull requests (including those made by a team member) must be approved by
  at least one other team member.

* Larger, more nuanced decisions about design, architecture, breaking changes,
  trade offs, etc are made by team consensus.
