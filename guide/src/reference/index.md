# Reference

This section contains reference material for using `wasm-bindgen`. It is not
intended to be read start to finish. Instead, it aims to quickly answer
questions like:

* Is type X supported as a parameter in a Rust function exported to JavaScript?

* What was that CLI flag to disable ECMAScript modules output, and instead
  attach the JavaScript bindings directly to `window`?
