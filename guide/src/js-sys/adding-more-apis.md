# Adding more APIs

We've got a [GitHub issue][issue] tracking the remaining APIs that need to be
added to the `js-sys` crate, and we'd love your help in contributing! The steps
to follow are:

* Comment on the issue saying which thing you are going to make bindings for
  (so that we don't accidentally duplicate effort).

* Open the [MDN
  page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects)
  for the relevant JS API.

* Open `crates/js-sys/src/lib.rs` in your editor; this is the file where we are
  implementing the bindings.

* Follow the instructions in the top of `crates/js-sys/src/lib.rs` about how to
  add new bindings.

* Add a test for the new binding to `crates/js-sys/tests/wasm/MyType.rs`

* Run the JS global API bindings tests with `cargo test -p js-sys --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`

* Send a pull request!
