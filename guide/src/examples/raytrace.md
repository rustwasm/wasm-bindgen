**This is an unstable and experimental example** of using threads with
WebAssembly and Rust, culminating in a parallel raytracer demo. The browser requirements are:

* Firefox Nightly 
  - `SharedArrayBuffer` is enabled in `about:config` in Firefox
* Google Chrome
  - No flags required on recent versions of Chrome
* other browsers haven't implemented the proposed WebAssembly features yet.

Locally to build this demo you'll need `xargo` and the `rust-src` rustup
component, and afterwards `./build.sh` like other examples should build the
example.

Again, to reiterate, this is all experimental and we're working through various
issues as we're working on this. If you're curious to see how this works it's
best to explore via the source code right now! More info will be available here
once WebAssembly threads are closer to stabilization.
