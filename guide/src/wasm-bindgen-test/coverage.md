# Generating Coverage Data

You can ask the runner to generate coverage data from functions marked as `#[wasm_bindgen_test]` in the `.profraw` format.

<div class="warning">
  Coverage is still in an experimental state, requires Rust Nightly, may be
  unreliable and could experience breaking changes at any time.
</div>

## Enabling the feature

To enable this feature, you need to set `cfg(wasm_bindgen_unstable_test_coverage)` for `wasm-bindgen-test` and its dependencies.

Currently it is particularly difficult to [deliver compile-line arguments to proc-macros when cross-compiling with Cargo][1]. To circumvent this [host-config] can be used.

[host-config]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#host-config

## Generating the data

### `RUSTFLAGS` that need to be present

Make sure you are using `RUSTFLAGS=-Cinstrument-coverage -Zno-profiler-runtime`.

Due to the current limitation of `llvm-cov`, we can't collect profiling symbols from the generated `.wasm` files. Instead, we can grab them from the LLVM IR with `--emit=llvm-ir` by using Clang. Usage of Clang or any LLVM tools must match the LLVM version used by Rust.

### Arguments to the test runner

The following environment variables can be used to control the coverage output when [executing the test runner][2]:

- `WASM_BINDGEN_UNSTABLE_TEST_PROFRAW_OUT` to control the file name of the profraw or the directory in which it is placed
- `WASM_BINDGEN_UNSTABLE_TEST_PROFRAW_PREFIX` to add a custom prefix to the profraw files. This can be useful if you're running the tests automatically in succession.

### Target features

This feature relies on the [minicov] crate, which provides a profiling runtime for WebAssembly. It in turn uses [cc] to compile the runtime to Wasm, which [currently doesn't support accounting for target feature][3]. Use e.g. `CFLAGS_wasm32_unknown_unknown="-matomics -mbulk-memory"` to account for that.

### Example

This adapts code taken from the [Rustc book], see that for more examples and general information on test coverage as well.

```sh
# Run the tests:
# - `CARGO_HOST_RUSTFLAGS` to pass the configuration to `wasm-bindgen-macro`.
# - `-Ztarget-applies-to-host -Zhost-config` to enable `CARGO_HOST_RUSTFLAGS`.
# - `--tests` to not run documentation tests, which is currently not supported.
CARGO_HOST_RUSTFLAGS=--cfg=wasm_bindgen_unstable_test_coverage \
RUSTFLAGS="-Cinstrument-coverage -Zno-profiler-runtime --emit=llvm-ir --cfg=wasm_bindgen_unstable_test_coverage" \
CARGO_TARGET_WASM32_UNKNOWN_UNKNOWN_RUNNER=wasm-bindgen-test-runner \
cargo +nightly test -Ztarget-applies-to-host -Zhost-config --tests
# Compile to object files:
# - Extract a list of compiled artifacts from Cargo and filter them with `jq`.
# - Figure out the path to the LLVM IR file corresponding to an artifact.
# - Compile to object file with Clang and store for later usage with `llvm-cov`.
