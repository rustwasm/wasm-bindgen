# Duck-Typed Interfaces Example

This directory is an example of using duck-typed JS interfaces with `wasm-bindgen`.

You can build and run the example with:

```
$ npm run serve
```

and then opening up `http://localhost:8080/` in a web browser should show a
smiley face drawn on canvas by Rust and WebAssembly.
