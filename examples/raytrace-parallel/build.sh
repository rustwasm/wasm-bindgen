# Two critical steps are required here to get this working:
#
# * First, the Rust standard library needs to be compiled. The default version
#   is not compatible with atomics so we need to compile a version, with xargo,
#   that is compatible.
#
# * Next we need to compile everything with the `atomics` feature enabled,
#   ensuring that LLVM will generate atomic instructions and such.

# currently compatible with atomics, so we go with the --no-modules output.
