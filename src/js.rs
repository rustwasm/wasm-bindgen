//! Bindings to JavaScript's standard, built-in objects, including their methods
//! and properties.
//!
//! This does *not* include any Web, Node, or any other JS environment
//! APIs. Only the things that are guaranteed to exist in the global scope by

//!
//! ## A Note About `camelCase`, `snake_case`, and Naming Conventions
//!
//! JavaScript's global objects use `camelCase` naming conventions for functions
//! and methods, but Rust style is to use `snake_case`. These bindings expose
//! the Rust style `snake_case` name. Additionally, acronyms within a method
//! name are all lower case, where as in JavaScript they are all upper case. For
//! example, `decodeURI` in JavaScript is exposed as `decode_uri` in these
//! bindings.

// When adding new imports:
//
// * Keep imports in alphabetical order.
//
// * Rename imports with `js_name = ...` according to the note about `camelCase`
// and `snake_case` in the module's documentation above.
//
// * Include the one sentence summary of the import from the MDN link in the
// module's documentation above, and the MDN link itself.
//
// * If a function or method can throw an exception, make it catchable by adding
// `#[wasm_bindgen(catch)]`.
//
// * Add a new `#[test]` to the `tests/all/js_globals.rs` file. If the imported
// function or method can throw an exception, make sure to also add test
// coverage for that case.
