//! Support for long-lived closures in `wasm-bindgen`
//!
//! This module defines the `Closure` type which is used to pass "owned
//! closures" from Rust to JS. Some more details can be found on the `Closure`
//! type itself.

/// A handle to both a closure in Rust as well as JS closure which will invoke
/// the Rust closure.
///
/// A `Closure` is the primary way that a `'static` lifetime closure is
/// transferred from Rust to JS. `Closure` currently requires that the closures
/// it's created with have the `'static` lifetime in Rust for soundness reasons.
///
/// This type is a "handle" in the sense that whenever it is dropped it will
/// invalidate the JS closure that it refers to. Any usage of the closure in JS
/// after the `Closure` has been dropped will raise an exception. It's then up
/// to you to arrange for `Closure` to be properly deallocate at an appropriate
/// location in your program.
///
/// The type parameter on `Closure` is the type of closure that this represents.
/// Currently this can only be the `Fn` and `FnMut` traits with up to 7
/// arguments (and an optional return value). The arguments/return value of the
/// trait must be numbers like `u32` for now, although this restriction may be
/// lifted in the future!
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// #[wasm_bindgen]
/// extern {
///     fn setTimeout(closure: &Closure<FnMut()>, time: u32);
///
///     #[wasm_bindgen(js_namespace = console)]
///     fn log(s: &str);
/// }
///
/// #[wasm_bindgen]
/// pub struct ClosureHandle(Closure<FnMut()>);
///
/// #[wasm_bindgen]
/// pub fn run() -> ClosureHandle {
///     // First up we use `Closure::new` to wrap up a Rust closure and create
///     a JS closure.
///     let cb = Closure::new(|| {
///         log("timeout elapsed!");
///     });
///
///     // Next we pass this via reference to the `setTimeout` function, and
///     // `setTimeout` gets a handle to the corresponding JS closure.
///     setTimeout(&cb, 1_000);
///
///     // If we were to drop `cb` here it would cause an exception to be raised
///     // when the timeout elapses. Instead we *return* our handle back to JS
///     // so JS can tell us later when it would like to deallocate this handle.
///     ClosureHandle(cb)
/// }
/// ```
