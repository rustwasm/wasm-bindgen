//! Support for long-lived closures in `wasm-bindgen`
//!
//! This module defines the `Closure` type which is used to pass "owned
//! closures" from Rust to JS. Some more details can be found on the `Closure`

/// A handle to both a closure in Rust as well as JS closure which will invoke
/// the Rust closure.
///
/// A `Closure` is the primary way that a `'static` lifetime closure is
/// transferred from Rust to JS. `Closure` currently requires that the closures
/// it's created with have the `'static` lifetime in Rust for soundness reasons.
///
/// This type is a "handle" in the sense that whenever it is dropped it will
/// invalidate the JS closure that it refers to. Any usage of the closure in JS
/// after the `Closure` has been dropped will raise an exception. It's then up
/// to you to arrange for `Closure` to be properly deallocate at an appropriate
/// location in your program.
///
/// The type parameter on `Closure` is the type of closure that this represents.
/// Currently this can only be the `Fn` and `FnMut` traits with up to 7
/// arguments (and an optional return value). The arguments/return value of the
/// trait must be numbers like `u32` for now, although this restriction may be
/// lifted in the future!
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Here are a number of examples of using `Closure`.
///
/// ## Using the `setInterval` API
///
/// Sample usage of `Closure` to invoke the `setInterval` API.
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
///
/// #[wasm_bindgen]
/// extern "C" {
///     fn setInterval(closure: &Closure<dyn FnMut()>, time: u32) -> i32;
///     fn clearInterval(id: i32);
///
///     #[wasm_bindgen(js_namespace = console)]
///     fn log(s: &str);
/// }
///
/// #[wasm_bindgen]
/// pub struct IntervalHandle {
///     interval_id: i32,
///     _closure: Closure<dyn FnMut()>,
/// }
///
/// impl Drop for IntervalHandle {
///     fn drop(&mut self) {
///         clearInterval(self.interval_id);
///     }
/// }
///
/// #[wasm_bindgen]
/// pub fn run() -> IntervalHandle {
///     // First up we use `Closure::wrap` to wrap up a Rust closure and create
///     // a JS closure.
///     let cb = Closure::wrap(Box::new(|| {
///         log("interval elapsed!");
///     }) as Box<dyn FnMut()>);
///
///     // Next we pass this via reference to the `setInterval` function, and
///     // `setInterval` gets a handle to the corresponding JS closure.
///     let interval_id = setInterval(&cb, 1_000);
///
///     // If we were to drop `cb` here it would cause an exception to be raised
///     // whenever the interval elapses. Instead we *return* our handle back to JS
///     // so JS can decide when to cancel the interval and deallocate the closure.
///     IntervalHandle {
///         interval_id,
///         _closure: cb,
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Casting a `Closure` to a `js_sys::Function`
///
/// This is the same `setInterval` example as above, except it is using
/// `web_sys` (which uses `js_sys::Function` for callbacks) instead of manually
/// writing bindings to `setInterval` and other Web APIs.
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use wasm_bindgen::JsCast;
///
/// #[wasm_bindgen]
/// pub struct IntervalHandle {
///     interval_id: i32,
///     _closure: Closure<dyn FnMut()>,
/// }
///
/// impl Drop for IntervalHandle {
///     fn drop(&mut self) {
///         let window = web_sys::window().unwrap();
///         window.clear_interval_with_handle(self.interval_id);
///     }
/// }
///
/// #[wasm_bindgen]
/// pub fn run() -> Result<IntervalHandle, JsValue> {
///     let cb = Closure::wrap(Box::new(|| {
///         web_sys::console::log_1(&"inverval elapsed!".into());
///     }) as Box<dyn FnMut()>);
///
///     let window = web_sys::window().unwrap();
///     let interval_id = window.set_interval_with_callback_and_timeout_and_arguments_0(
///         // Note this method call, which uses `as_ref()` to get a `JsValue`
///         // from our `Closure` which is then converted to a `&Function`
///         // using the `JsCast::unchecked_ref` function.
///         cb.as_ref().unchecked_ref(),
///         1_000,
///     )?;
///
///     // Same as above.
///     Ok(IntervalHandle {
///         interval_id,
///         _closure: cb,
///     })
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Using `FnOnce` and `Closure::once` with `requestAnimationFrame`
///
/// Because `requestAnimationFrame` only calls its callback once, we can use
/// `FnOnce` and `Closure::once` with it.
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
///
/// #[wasm_bindgen]
/// extern "C" {
///     fn requestAnimationFrame(closure: &Closure<dyn FnMut()>) -> u32;
///     fn cancelAnimationFrame(id: u32);
///
///     #[wasm_bindgen(js_namespace = console)]
///     fn log(s: &str);
/// }
///
/// #[wasm_bindgen]
/// pub struct AnimationFrameHandle {
///     animation_id: u32,
///     _closure: Closure<dyn FnMut()>,
/// }
///
/// impl Drop for AnimationFrameHandle {
///     fn drop(&mut self) {
///         cancelAnimationFrame(self.animation_id);
///     }
/// }
///
/// // A type that will log a message when it is dropped.
/// struct LogOnDrop(&'static str);
/// impl Drop for LogOnDrop {
///     fn drop(&mut self) {
///         log(self.0);
///     }
/// }
///
/// #[wasm_bindgen]
/// pub fn run() -> AnimationFrameHandle {
///     // We are using `Closure::once` which takes a `FnOnce`, so the function
///     // can drop and/or move things that it closes over.
///     let fired = LogOnDrop("animation frame fired or canceled");
///     let cb = Closure::once(move || drop(fired));
///
///     // Schedule the animation frame!
///     let animation_id = requestAnimationFrame(&cb);
///
///     // Again, return a handle to JS, so that the closure is not dropped
///     // immediately and JS can decide whether to cancel the animation frame.
///     AnimationFrameHandle {
///         animation_id,
///         _closure: cb,
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Converting `FnOnce`s directly into JavaScript Functions with `Closure::once_into_js`
///
/// If we don't want to allow a `FnOnce` to be eagerly dropped (maybe because we
/// just want it to drop after it is called and don't care about cancellation)
/// then we can use the `Closure::once_into_js` function.
///
/// This is the same `requestAnimationFrame` example as above, but without
/// supporting early cancellation.
///
/// ```
/// use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
///
/// #[wasm_bindgen]
/// extern "C" {
///     // We modify the binding to take an untyped `JsValue` since that is what
///     // is returned by `Closure::once_into_js`.
///     //
///     // If we were using the `web_sys` binding for `requestAnimationFrame`,
///     // then the call sites would cast the `JsValue` into a `&js_sys::Function`
///     // using `f.unchecked_ref::<js_sys::Function>()`. See the `web_sys`
///     // example above for details.
///     fn requestAnimationFrame(callback: JsValue);
///
///     #[wasm_bindgen(js_namespace = console)]
///     fn log(s: &str);
/// }
///
/// // A type that will log a message when it is dropped.
/// struct LogOnDrop(&'static str);
/// impl Drop for LogOnDrop {
///     fn drop(&mut self) {
///         log(self.0);
///     }
/// }
///
/// #[wasm_bindgen]
/// pub fn run() {
///     // We are using `Closure::once_into_js` which takes a `FnOnce` and

        // Here we need to create a `JsValue` with the data and `T::invoke()`
        // function pointer. To do that we... take a few unconventional turns.
        // In essence what happens here is this:
        //
        // 1. First up, below we call a function, `breaks_if_inlined`. This
        //    function, as the name implies, does not work if it's inlined.
        //    More on that in a moment.
        // 2. This function internally calls a special import recognized by the
        //    `wasm-bindgen` CLI tool, `__wbindgen_describe_closure`. This
        //    imported symbol is similar to `__wbindgen_describe` in that it's
        //    not intended to show up in the final binary but it's an
        //    intermediate state for a `wasm-bindgen` binary.
        // 3. The `__wbindgen_describe_closure` import is namely passed a
        //    descriptor function, monomorphized for each invocation.
        //
        // Most of this doesn't actually make sense to happen at runtime! The
        // real magic happens when `wasm-bindgen` comes along and updates our
        // generated code. When `wasm-bindgen` runs it performs a few tasks:
        //
        // * First, it finds all functions that call
        //   `__wbindgen_describe_closure`. These are all `breaks_if_inlined`
        //   defined below as the symbol isn't called anywhere else.
        // * Next, `wasm-bindgen` executes the `breaks_if_inlined`
        //   monomorphized functions, passing it dummy arguments. This will
        //   execute the function just enough to invoke the special import,
        //   namely telling us about the function pointer that is the describe
        //   shim.
        // * This knowledge is then used to actually find the descriptor in the
        //   function table which is then executed to figure out the signature
        //   of the closure.
        // * Finally, and probably most heinously, the call to
        //   `breaks_if_inlined` is rewritten to call an otherwise globally
        //   imported function. This globally imported function will generate
        //   the `JsValue` for this closure specialized for the signature in
        //   question.
        //
        // Later on `wasm-gc` will clean up all the dead code and ensure that
        // we don't actually call `__wbindgen_describe_closure` at runtime. This
        // means we will end up not actually calling `breaks_if_inlined` in the
        // final binary, all calls to that function should be pruned.
