/// A trait for checked and unchecked casting between JS types.

/// Specified [in an RFC][rfc] this trait is intended to provide support for
/// casting JS values between differnet types of one another. In JS there aren't
/// many static types but we've ascribed JS values with static types in Rust,
/// yet they often need to be switched to other types temporarily! This trait
/// provides both checked and unchecked casting into various kinds of values.
///
/// This trait is automatically implemented for any type imported in a
/// `#[wasm_bindgen]` `extern` block.
